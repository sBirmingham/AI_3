By the way, I'd like to mention. The past week, my hard drive decided to end itself, so I kinda lost everything that I had on my computer.
Fun, right?
Anyway, the file I used for this is the one I'm currently working on for a project in Software Engineering.
It's, uhh..., all I've got.

If you want some sort of proof because you think I'm just using this excuse to get out 
of the assignment (which makes no sense because if I were to do that, I wouldn't have done this one), I've got proof! 
Kinda! Again, it's all I got...

The attached picture shows the whole conversation I was having about it from the very beginning to the very end.
Monday, March 11. Last week. Uneditied except to string it all together. 
Enjoy the read. Despite what was happening, it was a pretty fun conversation. :p
